Near:
    - Check the outputs for proper wrap use.  eg GsfOutputGzip does not
    - rework proposed meta data framework to support improved understanding of
      MS Office
    - Complete MS property set read and write
    - work on GsfOutput error handling to propagate errors up the stack.
      Maybe something signal based ?
    - try to support canceling a write (eg we've written 1/2 a tmp file
      don't overwrite the real file)
    - for the stdio output check that we can actually write to the target file
      on open even though we do not want to write to it until later.

Longer:
    - More work on VBA directory parsing so that we can decompress
      source streams.
    - Add encrypt and decrypt wrappers
	- precede with some randomness due to static nature of xml header
	- be absolutely clear about how we handle seek (only encrypt data on
	  first pass)
    - Can we do we put a mechanism for signing and authenticating ?

Future:
    - parse vba p-code directly to produce some other language.
    - move biff utils here from gnumeric
