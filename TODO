Near:
    - rework proposed meta data framework to support improved understanding of
      MS Office
    - Complete MS property set read and write
    - work on GsfOutput error handling to propagate errors up the stack.
      Maybe something signal based ?

Longer:
    - More work on VBA directory parsing so that we can decompress
      source streams.

Future:
    - parse vba p-code directly to produce some other language.
    - move biff utils here from gnumeric
