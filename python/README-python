These are Python bindings for libgsf.

The input bindings are almost complete, but output is missing.

The bindings require gnome-python 1.99.10 or later. There is no
autoconfiscation for the Python bindings in libgsf/configure.in. This
will be added soon, but commented out, because we will use macros
which are only found in automake 1.5 and newer.

ex-1.py is a simple example.
