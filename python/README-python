**********************************************************************
I wrote these bindings in 2002, and they haven't been updated since.
They were never part of a standard build, but it was possible to build
them by following the instructions below. It will probably take some
work to make them work with current versions of autotools and
pygobject. Bindings would have to be revalidated, and extended to
match the current API of libgsf.

I do not plan to do further work on these bindings. If anybody wants
to pick them up, please feel free.

These are Python bindings for libgsf.

The bindings require gnome-python 1.99.10 or later. Building from CVS
requires a little manual intervention: 

- Remove 'dnl' from the beginning of the lines from AM_PATH_PYTHON
  down to the next line of asterisks in ../configure.in.
- Overwrite ../acinclude.m4 with ../acinclude.m4.am15
- Overwrite Makefile.am in this directory with Makefile.am15.
Then you may run autogen.sh.

The reasons for this setup are historical; these files should be merged.

Python 2.2 is required because gnome-python requires this. If you have
Python 2.2 installed with another name, e.g. /usr/bin/python2.2, you
can configure gnome-python and libgsf like this (assuming bash):

PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.2 ./configure

Gnumeric must be configured with the same Python version in order to
be able to use the Python gsf module. But the binary is specified in a
different way:

./configure --with-python=python2.2

Sorry about that!

ex-1.py is a simple example.
