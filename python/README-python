These are Python bindings for libgsf.

The input bindings are almost complete, but output is missing.

The bindings require gnome-python 1.99.10 or later. If you build from
CVS, you may bootstrap with Python bindings by removing 'dnl' from the
beginning of the lines from AM_PATH_PYTHON down to the next line of
asterisks in ../configure.in. You must also remove 'dnl' from the
beginning of each line in ../acinclude.m4. Then you may run
autogen.sh. You need automake1.5 or later.

Python 2.2 is required because gnome-python requires this. If you have
Python 2.2 installed with another name, e.g. /usr/bin/python2.2, you
can configure gnome-python and libgsf like this (assuming bash):

PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.2 ./configure

Gnumeric must be configured with the same Python version in order to
be able to use the Python gsf module. But the binary is specified in a
different way:

./configure --with-python=python2.2

Sorry about that!

ex-1.py is a simple example.
