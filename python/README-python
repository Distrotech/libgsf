These are Python bindings for libgsf.

The input bindings are almost complete, but output is missing.

The bindings require gnome-python 1.99.10 or later. If you build from
CVS, you may bootstrap with Python bindings by removing 'dnl' from the
beginning of the lines from AM_PATH_PYTHON down to the next line of
asterisks in ../configure.in and running autogen.sh. You need
automake1.5 or later.

ex-1.py is a simple example.
