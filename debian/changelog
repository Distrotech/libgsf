libgsf (1.9.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [debian/control] Dependencies overhaul.
    * Added libgsf-1-dev Depends: libxml2-dev. (Closes: #253013)
    * Added libgsf-1-dev Depends: libglib2.0-dev (as per libgsf-1.pc).
    * Added libgsf-1-dev, libgsf-gnome-1-dev Recommends: pkg-config as
      pkg-config is the recommended way of obtaining appropriate compilation
      and linking flags.
    * Removed libgsf-1-dev Depends: libbz2-dev as neither include files nor
      the .pc file refer to it, making the libbz dependency completely 
      contained within the runtime library.
