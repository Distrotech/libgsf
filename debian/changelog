libgsf (1.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, splitting GNOME-specific parts of into a separate
    library (so the base library can be used in non-GNOME projects).
  * Tightened build dependencies.
  * Used libtool package patched with the "inst-prefix" patch (see #57087)
    to produce an ltmain.sh that deals with un-installed shared libraries
    properly, so we can produce working libgsf-gnome-1(-dev) packages.
